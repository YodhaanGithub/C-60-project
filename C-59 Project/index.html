        <p>2 years ago I wasn't really interested in reading that much. Lets just say that I wasn't fond of it at all.<br><br>Then my teacher reccomended me a book and then I instantly fell in love with reading and soon it became one of my favourite hobbies. Another advantage I gained from reading was that I could right good stories since I increased my creativity from them as I was reading fiction. I even improved my vocabulary a lot.</p>
